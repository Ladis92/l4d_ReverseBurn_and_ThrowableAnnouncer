### `ReverseBurn and ThrowableAnnouncer`
(l4d_ReverseBurn_and_ThrowableAnnouncer) by *_Mystik Spiral_* and Marttt  

Left4Dead2 SourceMod plugin reverses damage if the victim is burned instantly and continuously.
It was created to help mitigate the damage by griefers attempting to kill/incap their teammates by burning them.

Features:  
- Burn damage is reversed only if victim(s) are burned instantly (within 0.75 second of ignition) and continuously.
- If burn victim gets out of the fire for more than a second (or fire goes out), burn damage stops being reversed.
- When burn damage is reversed, during each burn cycle:
	* Attacker takes 70% damage for each instantly/continously burned victim.
	* To get victims out of fire, convert 1PermHP to 2TempHP.
	* Already incapped burn victims or burn victims with only 1TotalHP do not take any burn damage.
- Bots do not take burn damage but do move out of the fire as quickly as possible.
- In all other scenarios, burn damage behaves normally.

Common Scenarios:  
- Griefer attempts to kill the whole team by burning them. Instead, the griefer takes 210% damage (70% per victim x 3 victims) plus possibly additional self-damage.  
Usual end result: Griefer is killed or incapped and everyone else takes only minor damage.  

- Player starts fire and griefer runs into it.  
Usual end result: Griefer takes 100% burn damage and player that started fire takes none, which is normal behavior.  

Suggestion:  

Use this plugin in conjunction with:  

**[ReverseBurn and ExplosionAnnouncer](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=331164)** (l4d_ReverseBurn_and_ThrowableAnnouncer)  
...and...  
**[Reverse Friendly-Fire](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=329035)** (l4d_reverse_ff)  

When these plugins are combined, griefers cannot inflict friendly-fire, molotov (throwable burns), or gascan (explosion type burns) damage, yet skilled players will likely not notice any difference in game play.

This plugin began life as **[Throwable Announcer](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=327613)** by Marttt.  None of the original code was changed, I just added the Reverse Burn feature to it since it already kept track of when an entity was exploded and announced who did it.  I hooked on to that announcement to track whether that explosion burned other players.
